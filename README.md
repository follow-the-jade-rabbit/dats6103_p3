You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/tapatia/dats6103_p3/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### 1. Motivation and Questions

According to the CDC, over 34 million Americans have diabetes, just a little over 1 person among every 10.
In light of this prevalence, I wanted to answer the following questions:

- Which demographic groups are overrepresented among diabetes patients?
- What are the diseases that tend to be co-morbid with diabetes?
- Which demographics have higher morality rates??
- Is there demographic bias in the care received?
- Does a longer hospital stay reduce later readmission?
- What do the records of the "most problematic" patients look like?


### 2. Dataset Source and Cleaning 

This dataset was imported without any changes from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, accessible [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008).

The original data was extracted from the Health Facts database, a voluntary program offered to organizations which use the Cerner Electronic Health Record System. Clinical care data was collected from 130 hospitals and integrated delivery networks throughout the U.S., from 1999 - 2008. Only inpatient visits where the patient had diabetes as an existing condition were included. More details on the data selection methodology can be accessed [here](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/781670/).
